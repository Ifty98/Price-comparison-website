# Price-comparison-website
I implemented a robust architecture that makes use of various technologies and frameworks to provide users with a seamless experience in the development of this watch comparison website. The center usefulness includes web scratching, where numerous strings, oversaw by a multithreading approach, simultaneously cross a rundown of URLs utilizing the Jsoup library. From various platforms, this scraping procedure extracts precise watch information like the brand, model, colour, and pricing.
This project's classes and dependencies are managed by the Spring Framework, resulting in a modular and well-organized codebase. Hibernate is used to interact with a relational database to persistently store the scraped data. Prior to putting away the gathered data, the framework cleverly checks for existing information in the data set to forestall duplication and keep up with information respectability.
Node.js and Express are used to build the backend of the web application, which provides a robust and effective API for handling user requests. Vue.js is used to create a responsive and dynamic user interface on the frontend. The web application sends a request to the server when users search for watches by name. The server then pulls relevant data from the database. After that, the server responds with information organized by models, enhancing the user experience on the results page by effectively displaying the watches in a paginated format for simple comparison.
After choosing a particular watch from the outcomes page, clients are diverted to the item page, starting one more solicitation to the server. This time, the server responds with color-coded information. The watch's available colours are then shown on the product page, allowing customers to select their preference.
The web application makes additional requests to the server to obtain pricing information and a list of websites where the selected watch in the selected colour is available, both of which enhance user interaction. On the website, a comprehensive response is presented, with links to the appropriate pages where customers can make their purchases. This insightful and client driven approach guarantees an easy-to-understand insight, working with watch correlations and giving smoothed out admittance to wanted item subtleties.
